# IML: "irregular" machine learning benchmarking toolkit

"Toolkit" of benchmark tools for measuring "irregular" machine learning workloads e.g. Reinforcement Learning (RL).

The current focus is on RL workloads, but these scripts are applicable to any ML TensorFlow script.

For documentation, see the [github wiki](https://github.com/UofT-EcoSystem/iml/wiki).
