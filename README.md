# RL-Scope: Cross-Stack Profiling for Deep Reinforcement Learning Workloads

RL-Scope collects cross-stack profiling information (CUDA API time, GPU kernel time, ML backend time, etc.), and provides a breakdown of CPU/GPU execution time.

For documentation, see the [github wiki](https://github.com/UofT-EcoSystem/iml/wiki).
