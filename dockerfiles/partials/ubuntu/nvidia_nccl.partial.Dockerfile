# #include "cuda/include/cublas_v2.h"
#
# I'm not sure why I was able to compile this before, but it's failing now.
# HACK: create symlink: /usr/include/cuda -> /usr/local/cuda
# As a result, compiler should find /usr/include/cuda/include/cublas_v2.h

# NOTE: in newever versions I think they are including CUDA headers in the tensorflow
# source tree (e.g. third_party/gpus/cuda/include/cublas_v2.h).
